\begin{itemize}
\item Teach courses on full-stack development and AI integration, covering both front-end frameworks and advanced algorithm design.
\end{itemize}

\divider

\cvevent{Research Assistant \& Developer}{National Chung Hsing University}{March 2017 -- August 2019}{Taiwan}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed and tested machine learning models and full-stack prototypes for image processing and data visualization.
\item Collaborated on projects that blended mathematical optimization techniques with practical software implementations.
\end{itemize}

\cvsection{Projects}

\cvevent{Industrial Full-Stack AI Platform for Safety}{JTB Technology Corp.}{2022 -- now}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed a full-stack platform integrating AI-driven object detection and segmentation with user-friendly dashboards.
\item Implemented end-to-end solutions from front-end interfaces to back-end APIs, enabling real-time safety monitoring and incident reporting.

\divider

\cvevent{Voice Agent and Chatbot}{MarcusLab}{2023 -- now}{}
\begin{itemize}
This project is an integrated voice and chatbot platform. The backend is built with Flask and SocketIO for real-time communication. It processes voice commands using tools like VAPI, Retell, and LiveKit, and enables chat functionality via SocketIO and WebRTC. Data is managed through NocoDB and other databases, while the solution supports embedding via iframes and integrates with messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. The entire system is deployed using Docker Compose.
\end{itemize}
